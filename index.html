        <h2>Remembering Her Life</h2>
        <p class="center-justified">
            Mercedes Galanto Quinol, affectionately known as Mercy, passed away on September 27, 2023, at the age of 83 due to complications related to lung cancer. She is survived by her devoted husband, Agustin (Butch), two sisters, Rebecca, and Gloria, two brothers Pablo and Jeremiah, four daughters and their partners, Frances and Bradley, Joy and Steve, Tina and Jason, and Sheila and Brian. She is also survived by five beloved grandchildren and their significant others, Austin and Toni, Christian and Dena, Mackenzie, Adelyn, and Genevieve, as well as numerous cherished family, friends, and colleagues.
        </p>
        <p class="center-justified">
            Mercy's journey began in the Philippines as one of twelve siblings, where her early childhood was filled with love, warmth, and a strong example of what it means to be a family. It was during these formative years that she developed a deep faith in her Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Her unwavering faith remained a guiding light throughout her life, offering hope, strength, and comfort to those fortunate enough to know her.
        </p>
        <p class="center-justified">    
            In her academic and professional pursuits, Mercy exhibited extraordinary talent and a deep passion for nursing. She was a proud member of the pioneer class of 1962 at UERMMMCI College of Nursing in Quezon City, Philippines, which celebrated its Diamond Anniversary in July of 2022. Her dedication led her to the United States, where she became a registered nurse. Her calling as an oncology nurse at St. Francis Hospital of Evanston earned her the well-deserved title of Nurse of the Year in 2004. She later turned her natural gifts toward leading her fellow practitioners as a manager through the end of a fulfilling 50-year career.
        </p>
        <p class="center-justified">    
            While pursuing her career in the United States, Mercy's heart was captured by Agustin Quinol. They were inseparable over their 57-year marriage and almost always surrounded by a growing network of family and friends. By every measure she was the gravity that gathered and united an extended family and her memory still brings out the best in each of us.  
        </p>
        <p class="center-justified">    
            Mercy's unyielding spirit refused to be defined by her disease, even in her final days. Her radiant smile, infectious laughter, and compassionate nature left an indelible mark on all who knew her. What stood out most was her extraordinary gift for hospitality, always ensuring that those around her were cared for and comforted. Mercy’s love was often expressed through her amazing food, crafted to perfection, and freely offered to anyone who visited.  Her warm and inviting personality immediately endeared her to everyone, making her a cherished presence in our lives. 
        </p>
        <p class="center-justified">   
            Mercy's departure has left a void, but her vibrant and compassionate soul now resides in Heaven, where loved ones eagerly anticipate a joyous reunion. As a great friend recently said, “Wherever Mercy is I know there’s an amazing party going on. I can’t wait to join and celebrate with her again”.
